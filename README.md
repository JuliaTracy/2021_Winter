# 2021_Winter
This repository displays what Julia Li have explored herself since she became an undergraduate.

***Class1***Visualization
During the epidemic last winter, Julia Li made many attempts to make the COVID-19, which we were all concerned about, more vividly shown in front of our eyes.
Thus, she tried to learn some python libraries like matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, turtle, pyecharts and so on. Although they may be too childish for a large number of people, I was really exited to discover a brand new world, which is exotic and amazing.
1. 2D_virus.py: display the viration of the detected patients in China from Jan to Feb in 2020
2. death&recovered.py: display how many people died and recovered during a short period of time
3. dog.py: draw a cute dog to enlighten people
4. heart.py: draw a adorable heart to show love
5. world.py: show how COVID-19 affected the entire world
6. virus.py: display the detected, the recovered and the died in 3D form
7. SIR.py: use SIR model to predict how the epidemic would spread
8. risk.py: hospitalisation fatality risk from Jan 20th to Feb 12th
9. map.py: show a map of detected person and the flight routes to and from Wuhan

Other tries not related to COVID-19: (for environmental anlysis mostly)
1. polifit.py: just tried how to do statistics in python hhh
2. Beijing&Tianjin.py: AQI of Beijing and Tianjin in 2019
3. Beijing_PM2.5.py, Hebei_PM2.5.py: PM2.5 of Beijing,Tianjin in 2019(viration)
4. Beijing_Season.py, Shijiazhuang_Season.py: how PM2.5 level changes in different seasons in Beijing, Shijiazhuang
5. PM2.5_JJJ.py: comparison of PM2.5 level among Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang in 2019
6. 北京.py, 天津.py, 河北.py: maps showing how PM2.5 disperse in different areas of BTH
7. Character.py: use turtle to write several vivid characters

***Class2***File Process
It is really hard for me who are not quite familiar with Microsoft to deal with a large quantities of files and data. In order to improve my efficiency, I wrote/cited some codes to handle file types like excel, csv, nc and so on. Some of codes I have created are as follows.
